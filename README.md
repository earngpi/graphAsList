# graphAsList

Implemented graph data structure using lists of vertices and edges. Learnt so much of edgy cases that might occur from error inputs and indexing, the many flexible ways one could implement a single method and how powerful a simple data structure can be.

NOTE THAT the methods here only work on undirected and connected graph. Directed graph will require some editing. Disconnected graphs or forest of trees will not be able to utillise these methods. Only when they are seperated and manipulated one by one, will the methods work. For example, in a forest of trees, find MST of each tree individually will give the minimum spanning forest. The way to make them work on disconnected tree/graph would be similar to the way I did as part of the Kruskal's code. I may update them to be able to work on different kinds of graphs, but that won't be so soon.
